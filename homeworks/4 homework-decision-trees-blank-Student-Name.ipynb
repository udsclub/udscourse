    "#### Briefly about Validation / Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning the parameters of a prediction function and testing it on the same data is a methodological mistake: a model that would just repeat the labels of the samples that it has just seen would have a perfect score but **would fail to predict anything useful on yet-unseen data. This situation is called overfitting**. \n",
    "<br>To avoid it, it is common practice when performing a (supervised) machine learning experiment to hold out part of the available data as a test set ```X_test, y_test```. \n",
    "<br>Note that the word “experiment” is not intended to denote academic use only, because even in commercial settings machine learning usually starts out experimentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating different settings (“hyperparameters”) for estimators, **there is still a risk of overfitting on the test set** because the parameters can be tweaked until the estimator performs optimally. \n",
    "<br>This way, knowledge about the test set can “leak” into the model and evaluation metrics no longer report on generalization performance. \n",
    "<br>To solve this problem, yet another part of the dataset can be held out as a so-called “validation set”: training proceeds on the training set, after which evaluation is done on the validation set, and when the experiment seems to be successful, final evaluation can be done on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by partitioning the available data into three sets, **we drastically reduce the number of samples which can be used for learning the model, and the results can depend on a particular random choice for the pair of (train, validation) sets.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to this problem is a procedure called **cross-validation (CV for short). A test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV**. In the basic approach, called k-fold CV, the training set is split into k smaller sets (other approaches are described below, but generally follow the same principles). The following procedure is followed for each of the k “folds”:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A model is trained using k-1 of the folds as training data;\n",
    "- the resulting model is validated on the remaining part of the data \n",
    "<br>(i.e., it is used as a test set to compute a performance measure such as accuracy).\n",
    "        \n",

    "\n",
    "The performance measure reported by k-fold cross-validation **is then the average of the values computed in the loop**. \n",
    "<br>This approach can be computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data (as it is the case when fixing an arbitrary test set), which is a major advantage in problem such as inverse inference where the number of samples is very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some classification problems can **exhibit a large imbalance in the distribution of the target classes: for instance there could be several times more negative samples than positive samples**. \n",
    "<br>In such cases it is recommended to use **stratified sampling** as implemented in sklearn's StratifiedKFold and StratifiedShuffleSplit to ensure that relative class frequencies is approximately preserved in each train and validation fold.\n",
